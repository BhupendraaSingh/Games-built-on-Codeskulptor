# Games-built-on-Codeskulptor

It contains some games which I created during my Coursera IIP course and Card game memory is not part of IIP course.
These are built with help of module named Simplegui on Codeskupltor ( An online Python interpreter web app).

Attention these would not run properly in Python because our python doesn't come with simplegui module built-in.
You can install the 'simplegui' module separately, if you find it the correct one or the same.
